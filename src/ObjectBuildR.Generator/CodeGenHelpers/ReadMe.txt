Thanks for downloading the AvantiPoint CodeGenHelpers. This helper library will help you more easily write Source Generators with a pattern that allows you to pass in strings, some System Type's or Roslyn Type Symbols. The generated code can be added to the builder in any order and will output a nicely formatted source file.

To make this easier to deal with, the CodeGenHelpers have been added as linked source code to eliminate issues with assembly references.
