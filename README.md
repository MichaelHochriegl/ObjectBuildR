# ObjectBuildR
> Bringing you closer to neat builders without the hassle
>This project aims at helping you get the [Builder Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) going without you writing the boilerplate code.


## General Information
This project uses dotnet Source Generators to do the heavy lifting needed to get builders up and running.
With this lib you can focus on only writing the code to get the specific functionality in your builders.

## Techstack
